Categorical variables with forcats

**Summary**

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop run at the Hertie School, Berlin in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course Introduction to Data Science taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

**Session contents**

This session will introduce you to manipulating categorical variables in R using forcats. forcats is the R package to work with factors. A factor is the R data structure for categorical data, that is, variables having a fixed and known set of possible values.
Factors are also useful when working with character vectors, such as reordering them to improve visualizations.

**Main learning objectives**

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about factors and the forcats package (2) show you the five key functions of the pacakge, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.
