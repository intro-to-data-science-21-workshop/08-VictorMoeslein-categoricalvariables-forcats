# Working with categorical variables in R using forcats

## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.


## Session contents 

This session will introduce you to manipulating categorical variables in R using `forcats`. `forcats` is the R package to work with factors. A factor is the R data structure for categorical data, that is, variables having a fixed and known set of possible values. Factors are useful when working with character vectors that need to be ordered, for visualization purposes and for conducting statistical analysis dealing with ordered data (e.g. ordinal regressions).

## Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about factors and the forcats package (2) show you key functions of the package, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as some further readings.
